# Pascal-s-Triangle-Generator
A generator for the highly useful Pascal's Triangle built using functions, data structures, and conditions; this really helped explaining the concept to Math Club Members. 
Worked on this as a part of my collection of Python Projects over the COVID-19 pandemic (Grade 10-12)
